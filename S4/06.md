## Course Modules

### Module 1: Foundations of Pattern Recognition
- Introduction: definitions, applications, and system overview.  
- Statistical Pattern Recognition: Bayes decision theory, parametric methods (MLE, Bayesian estimation).  
- Non-Parametric Methods: k-nearest neighbors, Parzen windows.  

### Module 2: Feature Extraction and Selection
- Feature Extraction: importance, PCA, LDA, feature extraction in image and signal processing.  
- Feature Selection: importance, techniques (filter, wrapper methods), selection criteria.  

### Module 3: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised Learning: basics, linear classifiers (perceptron, logistic regression), SVM.  
- Unsupervised Learning: clustering (k-means, hierarchical), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).  

### Module 4: Advanced Topics and Applications
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM): basics, sequence modeling, applications in speech/language.  
- Ensemble Methods: bagging, boosting, random forests, applications.  
- Real-world applications and case studies: image and speech recognition, future trends.
